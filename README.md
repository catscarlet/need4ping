# need4ping
Rewrite my old respositories of **needforping** [[1]](https://github.com/catscarlet/needforping) [[2]](https://github.com/catscarlet/needforping2) [[3]](https://github.com/catscarlet/needforping3) [[4]](https://github.com/catscarlet/needforpingthinksmarty).

Thinking about using php, js and bash to rewrite it, and maybe using **docker** for deploying.

There will be a while before I can working on it.
